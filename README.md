# Experience

## 3Squared

### Mobile Application Developer

#### 2011

Worked with an existing iPhone & Web development team to produce high-quality Android applications for 3Squared's clients. Made use of XML APIs and Android C2DM (push notifications). In this role I also began to work more with iOS, beginning with an iPad 'catalog' app project for a high-profile client.

## 368 Ltd.

### Android Application Developer

#### 2011

Worked as part of a 5-man team on an Android tablet application for the newspaper and magazine market. Used the latest Android technologies introduced with _Honeycomb_ (version 3.0 of Android). Primarily targeted the Motorola Xoom tablet device. The app included in-app billing, content synchronisation with remote servers, custom views and lots of user-interface polish.

## G Media

### Android Application Developer

#### 2011

Developed an Android radio streaming application which could be easily configured and styled allowing it to be repackaged and sold to many clients. G Media had an existing iPhone application, but no experience on the Android platform. I was tasked with replicating the functionality of the iOS app in Java, but taking full advantage of the Android OS, and in keeping with the visual style present on the platform. The released apps are available on the Android Market, [published by G Media](https://market.android.com/developer?pub=G+Media) as well as [their clients](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.gmedia.planetrock&feature=search_result). More information about the app is available from [G Media's website.](http://gmedia.co.uk/products/mobile-apps/)

## Websell Masters

### Web Developer

#### 2008-2011

Worked to produce high quality websites, mainly focusing on the tourism industry. I was tasked with creating designs for the clients' consideration using Adobe Fireworks, then, once a design was agreed upon, constructing the site using XHTML+CSS+JS up to the latest W3C standards. Most sites would require PHP work, which I was also responsible for, along with updating and maintaining older websites. I pushed for greater use of the new features introduced with PHP5, as many previous sites were PHP4 only. This including developing a custom e-commerce site with shopping cart using object-oriented PHP5 and MySQL. Other major projects I was involved with include assisting with the development of a recruitment site, and a large tourism focused directory. In this role I also took on the responsibility of training new employees in best practices and the use of our systems.

# Side Projects

## SafeTrip (Cross-platform Mobile Application)

### Team Member

#### 2011 - Current

Attended a local hackathon (Silicon Valley Comes To The UK) in which we used open Government data to back mobile applications. Formed a team along with 3 others and produce a working prototype based on an idea of my own which I had previously investigated as part of my dissertation - giving directions to the user which avoid high-risk areas by using the street-level data on crimes. In the 2-day hackathon, we produced a web app version usable on all modern smartphones, using HTML5 and JavaScript. The app was chosen as a regional winner, and our team went on to come in the top 8 nationally, which led to the team visiting No. 10 Downing Street to recieve our awards. Development continues on this app, with native versions for iPhone and Android nearing completion.

## Astronomy Picture of the Day (Android Application)

### Sole Developer

#### 2010 - 2011

Using the Astronomy Picture of the Day as provided by NASA, the app allows users to set it as their 'homescreen' wallpaper, as well as browse through the collection. On the server side, I used Google App Engine to process the large images provided by NASA and to output JSON representations of the information associated with each. The app is currently available in the Android Market, along with another 4 of my applications. As of now it has received over 95,000 downloads. Details of my self-published applications can be found on the [Android Market ](https://market.android.com/developer?pub=Sam+Oakley). Recently updated this app to make use of the new features of Android 3.0 and 4.0, including a new interface designed specially for tablets, such as the Motorola Xoom & Samsung Galaxy Tab.

# Education & University Projects

## ELTC Room Booking System

### Genesys Solutions

#### 2011 - Current

Genesys Solutions is a student-run software development group and a division of epiGenesys, a wholly owned subsidiary of The University of Sheffield specialising in the implementation of web applications, and whose services are particularly suitable for the development of small information systems and software prototypes. Working in a medium-sized group, we were tasked with producing a software system for a real client. Gained exposure to Ruby & Rails along with more experience with Software Development techniques such as Test and Behavior Driven Development.

## Semantic Textual Similarity

### Darwin Research Project

#### 2011 - Current

My final year research project aims to produce a system which can quantifiably inform us how similar two short sentences are, resulting in a similarity score. This will be done by using existing approaches (such as N-gram overlap) which will be extended using one of several techniques that have been proposed. The philosophy of the Darwin project is to give students at fourth year and Masters level some insight into the research process by applying scientific research methodology to a small group research project.

## Mining & Integrating a Large Amount of Information from the Web

### Undergraduate Dissertation

#### 2010 - 2011

The dissertation completed as part of my degree course involved creating several 'mashups' using data about the local area. The mashups were both innovative and useful. The data is gathered from the semantic web of data, as well as from my own mining and scraping of web content. Combining the data and using language processing techniques allowed new observations to be made. The idea of the semantic web is a focus of the project, and all data will be made available in structured formats.

## Sheffield Raising & Giving Society (Website)

### Developer

#### 2010

As part of my degree course, I, along with the 4 other members of the team, designed and created a new website for the RAG society. This involved several client meetings in order to establish the requirements (which included an online event registration system), followed by the development of a system to meet them. Technologies used involved PHP combined with the CodeIgniter framework, as well as XHTML+CSS and Javascript on the front end. In competition with 3 other groups, our system was chosen as the winner and is now live as the new site.

## Sheffield Raising & Giving Society (Android Application)

### Sole Developer

#### 2010

As part of the aforementioned project, I created an Android app to interface with the website, downloading the details of events and presenting them in a format better suited to a mobile device. This was not an assessed part of the course; rather, I wished to learn how to develop for the platform. The app is currently available in the Android Market.

## University of Sheffield

### Software Engineering (MEng)

#### 2007-Present

Expected First or 2:1.
