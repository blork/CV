My name is Sam Oakley, and I am writing to apply for the job of Software Engineer. I am currently undertaking the 4th and final year of my Software Engineering (MEng) Degree course at the University of Sheffield.   
  
I believe that I am a strong candidate for the position. As part of my Software Engineering course, I have worked in teams to produce high-quality projects using software development processes such as the Agile method. I am always looking to learn about new technologies and to expand and improve my skill set, and I believe this job would help me to do so. My strongest areas are working with the web and with mobile devices. I have 4 years experience with web development, using PHP, Java, Python, and most recently Ruby for back-end development as well as  HTML/CSS/JS for user interfaces. Recently I have been involved more in the development of native applications, mostly for Android devices, but also iOS. These include several freelance projects for clients, as well as 'hobby' apps developed in my spare time which are available in the Android Market under my name.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and the included CV, and I sincerely hope you consider me for the position.

If you need to contact me, please telephone or email me at the attached address. 

Respectfully yours, 
Samuel Oakley
